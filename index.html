    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
        Users access the ColorNote service (“Service”) through the application, through APIs, and through third-parties.
        A “Device” is any computer used to access the ColorNote Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop,
        mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the
        ColorNote Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Service you consent to the collection,
        transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different
        forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>

    <h2>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h2>
    <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the ColorNote Service:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> When you register for an account, we collect some Personal
            Information, such as your name and email address. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us
            access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking
            information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. You may also
            provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive
            Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried
            to share something with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Data.</strong> We collect and store data you upload, download, or access with the Service
            (“Data”).</li>
        <li><strong>Log Data.</strong> When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device,
            its software, and your activity using the Service. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”)
            address, information you search for through the Service, locale preferences, identification numbers
            associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps, system configuration information,
            and other interactions with the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Service. A cookie is
            a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration
            ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain
            features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate
            usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to
            stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not
            accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Personal Information And Why</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information
        that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used:
        (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand
        your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software
        updates and product announcements. If we communicate with you, and you no longer wish to receive communications
        from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your
        settings information.</p>
        <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p><strong>Use.</strong> We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share or disclose your
        information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see
        below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information
        public.</p>

    <p><strong>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</strong> We use certain trusted third party companies
        and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage,
        maintenance services, database management, analytics, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third
        parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under
        obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. You can view the third parties we use to help us provide
        our Service in Appendix 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-Party Applications.</strong> We may share your information with a third party application with your
        consent, for example when you choose to access our Service through such an application. We are not responsible
        for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it
        has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>

    <p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of ColorNote’s Rights.</strong> We may
        disclose to parties outside ColorNote Data and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith
        belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request;
        (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of
        ColorNote or its users; or (d) to protect ColorNote’s property rights.</p>

    <p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of
        our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for
        example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal
        Information or Data, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of
        choices you may have regarding the information.</p>

    <p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or
        otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights Relating To Your Information</h2>
    <p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@socialnmobile.com">support@socialnmobile.com</a> to ask us to
        provide access to, correct, update, or delete your personal information. We may ask you for proof of account
        ownership and/or identity before fulfilling your request. This is a security measure to ensure that your
        information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In some cases we may retain copies of
        your information if required by law. Please note that some or all of your personal information may be required
        in order for us to provide you with access to the certain specific functionalities of our Service.</p>

    <p><strong>For Residents in the EU</strong></p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (also known as GDPR) provides you with additional rights regarding your
        personal information. If you are within the EU, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Request access to your personal information.</strong> This enables you to receive a copy of the
            information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you.</strong> This enables you to
            have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
        <li><strong>Request erasure of your personal information.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or
            remove information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.</li>
        <li><strong>Object to processing of your personal information.</strong> This right exists where we are relying
            on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular
            situation, which makes you want to object to processing of your information on this ground. You also have
            the right to object where we are processing your information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information.</strong> This enables you to ask
            us to suspend the processing of your information, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or
            the reason for processing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Request the transfer of your personal information.</strong> We will provide to you your personal
            information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
            automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
            perform a contract with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent.</strong> This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process your
            information (“Consent Withdrawal”). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with
            access to the certain specific functionalities of our Service. We will advise you if this is the case at the
            time you withdraw your consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or submit a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy,
        please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@socialnmoble.com">support@socialnmoble.com</a> with “GDPR
        Request” in the subject line. In the email, please describe, with specificity, the GDPR right you are requesting
        assistance with. If you feel that your complaint has not been adequately resolved, please note that the GDPR
        gives you the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority.</p>

    <p><strong>For Residents of California</strong></p>
    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (also known as CCPA) provides you with additional rights regarding your
        personal information. If you are a California resident, these terms and conditions apply to you.</p>

            browser type, language and time zone;</li>
        <li>Interaction with our software or apps such as usage data, type and version of operating system, hardware
            version, device settings, software types, battery and signal strength, screen resolution, device

    </ul>
    <p>In the preceding 12 months, we may have used and disclosed personal information for the business and commercial
        purposes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Access specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months.</li>
        <li>Request to know the categories of personal information we have collected about you and the purposes for

    </ul>

    <h2>5. How Long We Store Your Information</h2>
    <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We
        may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
        enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon
        request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and
        backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you
        have in common with other users.</p>

    <h2>6. Where We Store Your Information</h2>
    <p>If you register for an account and sync your device with our Service, your Information (including but not limited
        your Data), will be stored on servers hosted by Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Service. For information
        regarding Google Cloud Platform Data Processing and Security Terms, please visit <a
            href="https://cloud.google.com">https://cloud.google.com</a>. For information regarding Amazon Web Service,
        please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">https://aws.amazon.com</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>For Residents in the EU</strong></p>
    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, please note that Google’s
        certification under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks includes Google Cloud Platform. Google
        has also gained confirmation of compliance from European Data Protection Authorities for their model contract
        clauses, affirming that their current contractual commitments for Google Cloud Platform fully meet the
        requirements under the Data Protection Directive to legally frame transfers of personal data from the EU to the
        rest of the world. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Service offers customers a Data Processing Addendum, including Model
        Clauses (Data Processing Addendum) that was approved in 2015 by the EU data protection authorities, known as the
        Article 29 Working Party. This Data Processing Addendum enables customers, when using AWS to transfer personal
        data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), to any country, including to the US.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card
        number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology
        (SSL).</p>

    <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and
        once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we
        cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
        from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with
        Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a
            href="mailto:support@socialnmobile.com">support@socialnmobile.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under
        13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back from time to time. If we make a change to
        this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for
        example, by email). By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound
        by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Social & Mobile, Inc. welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy. Please contact us by email at <a
