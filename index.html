    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
        Users access the ColorNote service (“Service”) through the application, through APIs, and through third-parties.
        A “Device” is any computer used to access the ColorNote Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop,
        mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the
        ColorNote Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Service you consent to the collection,
        transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different
        forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>

    <h2>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h2>
    <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the ColorNote Service:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> When you register for an account, we collect some Personal
            Information, such as your name and email address. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us
            access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking
            information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. You may also
            provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive
            Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried
            to share something with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Data.</strong> We collect and store data you upload, download, or access with the Service
            (“Data”).</li>
        <li><strong>Log Data.</strong> When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device,
            its software, and your activity using the Service. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”)
            address, information you search for through the Service, locale preferences, identification numbers
            associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps, system configuration information,
            and other interactions with the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Service. A cookie is
            a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration
            ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain
            features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate
            usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to
            stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not
            accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Personal Information And Why</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information
        that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used:
        (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand
        your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software
        updates and product announcements. If we communicate with you, and you no longer wish to receive communications
        from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your
        settings information.</p>
