    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.
        Users access the Notate application. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Notate
        application, regardless of how you access it, and by using our services you consent to the collection, transfer,
        processing, storage, disclosure, and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of
        data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>

    <h2>1. Notes</h2>
    <p>All of the notes that user creates are stored in the app's internal storage. The notes can't be accessed by any
        other app on the phone. The only way to access the notes is to use the app. To be clear: only user of the app can
        see notes stored on the phone.</p>

    <h2>2. Email Address</h2>
    <p>Using "Technical support" in the app will open an email app and allow sending an email to 0natalya2000@gmail.com.
        After receiving an email, the user's address will be used only to answer questions or problems related to the
        app. Email addresses are not stored anywhere outside the email service provider used by the developer
        (outlook.com).</p>

    <h2>3. Information Collected</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> IP address, advertising ID, device identifiers</li>
        <li><strong>Geolocation data:</strong> IP address, country, region, language set on a device</li>
        <li><strong>Internet or other electronic network activity information:</strong> IP address, advertising ID,
            cookies, activity in app such as time spent on each screen</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Purposes of Collecting Information</h2>
    <p>This app uses Firebase and Google Analytics for Firebase as an analytic tool, providing information about app
        usage such as the number of active users, most popular devices, etc. The information is used to analyze
        performance of the app and detect any problems, for example, after publishing an update. Advertising ID is not
        collected; therefore, no demographics or interests data is collected.</p>

    <h2>5. Selling "Personal" Information</h2>
    <p>The app displays ads on some devices. If personalized advertising is enabled, then ad networks may use information
        listed above: advertising ID, IP address, etc. Sharing this information may be considered as a sale under
        California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users in the EEA and California have rights to access, obtain, delete, or opt-out of selling personal information.
        Please contact notepad.free.privacy@outlook.com to exercise any of these rights.</p>

    <h2>7. Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>All policy changes will be reflected by updates to this document.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Deletion and Retention</h2>
    <p>Data used by analytic tools can be deleted upon request. Requests can be made from sending an email to 0natalya2000@gmail.com.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
